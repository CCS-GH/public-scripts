## I want to participate
If you want to participate, there are many softwares to edit the [fountain format](https://fountain.io/).
For an easy integration with GitHub[^2], I would recommend using VS Code[^1] together with the [Better Fountain](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=piersdeseilligny.betterfountain) plugin.

### Tutorials
While installing the addon and using it together with git is fairly straight forward for programmers[^3], they aren't the target group.
Therefore I've searched for tutorials that could help, namely:

Git [Long]: https://youtu.be/HkdAHXoRtos  


[^1]: This software is a regular for many programmers. We use it to avoid having to use a seperate git client while having a flawless fountain integration.
[^2]: Git is a version control system that helps to keep an overview on who wrote what and how to merge diffrent ideas. Imagine the chaos trying to cordinate script writing in a discord chat.
[^3]: or rather most tech-savvy people, but the tutorials give a good overview anyway
